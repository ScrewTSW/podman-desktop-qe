### Silent/Headless installation ###
####################################
# Requirements
- Podman Desktop Windows installer downloaded

# Windows installer
https://podman-desktop.io/downloads/windows

# Podman Desktop installation console steps
$ Start-Process -FilePath '.\podman-desktop-0.13.0-setup.exe' -ArgumentList "\S" -Wait

# Podman Desktop installation process 
No console output, terminal starts the installation in a separate window, after successfull installation Podman Desktop app launches.


###########################
### Portable executable ###
###########################
# Requirements 
- Podman Desktop Windows portable executable downloaded

# Windows portable executable
https://podman-desktop.io/downloads

# Podman Desktop launch
$ cd folder_with_the_executable
$ podman-desktop-0.13.0.exe


#####################################################
### Airgapped/Restricted environment installation ###
#####################################################
# Requirements 
- Linux WSL installed (not required for only testing the installation)
- Windows installer for restricted environments downloaded 

# Windows installer for restricted environments 
https://podman-desktop.io/downloads/windows

# Podman Desktop installation process 
Same as headless.


##########################
### Local installation ###
##########################
# Requirements
- node.js >=v16.3 installed
- npm >= 8.1 installed

# Compile process console steps
- clone and cd repo
$ npm install
$ npm run compile:current
-> Headless and restricted environment install
$ Start-Process -FilePath '.\dist\podman-desktop-0.15.0-next-setup.exe' -ArgumentList "\S" -Wait
(this installs podman desktop and opens it right away, works the same without internet connection)
-> Portable executable 
$ .\dist\win-unpacked\"Podman Desktop.exe"
$ .\dist\podman-desktop-0.15.0-next.exe
(different ways to run it, both start at a different podman desktop view)
-> choco install from local chocolatey repo downloads from github anyways, doesn't work
-> scoop and winget need manifests for local install but those also just download the package from specified urls, don't work
